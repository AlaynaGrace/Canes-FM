# Canes FM

Cane's FM is essentially a biased randomizer. At Cane's, there are five different areas of emphasis that need to be focused on. The managers go into an excel file and rank different issues that need to be fixed in each area of emphasis. Then, Canes FM takes those ranked lists in, randomly picks two of those issues, and prints out the issues it picks. The process is not completely random, however, as the issues closer to the top of the list are more likely to be printed out compared to issues that are lower on the list.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To get this application running, you will need to have an Excel file with at least 5 rows and you will need to have Python 3.4 downloaded.

### Installing

1. Fork and clone this repo.

2. In terminal run

```
$ python Canes3.py
$ canes3()
```

3. The application will ask for a file name. Use the full path name to your Excel file.

4. The application will also ask for an output file name. Again, use the full path name to the output file.
